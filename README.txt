The controls are simple: just move your cursor over your selections and click!

The purpose of this game isn't to win, but rather to see how long the player can "hang on" to both their life and their humanity. However, the progress bars are unlabeled, so when the player sees changes, it's supposed to force them to evaluate their own choices and question their decisions.
This submission for Chillenium includes the first day of playthrough, with over a dozen choices to be made that not only effects the player's progress bars, but also their ability to do things in the future, with the player's inventory.
